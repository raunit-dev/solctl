# solctl â€“ Minimal Solana CLI Tool

A lightweight Solana CLI written in Rust using `clap` and the Solana RPC client, made for interacting with the Solana **devnet**.  
Supports SOL transfers, airdrops, and balance checks â€“ with default wallet fallback from `~/.config/solana/id.json`.

> Built out of boredom. Contributions welcome!
